Enabling sticky-session
To achieve sticky-session, there are two main solutions:
    - routing clients based on a cookie (recommended solution)
    - routing clients based on their originating address

You will find below some examples with common load-balancing solutions:
    - NginX (IP-based)
    - Apache HTTPD (cookie-based)
    - HAProxy (cookie-based)
    - Traefik (cookie-based)
    - Node.js cluster module
